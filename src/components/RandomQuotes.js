You'll be in the same place next year. Call yourself out. Stop putting it off. Two. Successful People are not constantly glued to their screens, watching motivation and productivity videos. Take what you need to put yourself away and do what you already know you need to do. Three. Being busy is a convenient excuse to avoid doing the things you afraid to do. Catch yourself when you know you're avoiding. Four. No one wants to hear you complain about your problems for the 10th time and what you do nothing about it. Figure out what you need to do. Create a plan and execute. Five. Whether you like it or not, your life and your opportunity window is disappearing faster than you realize. It's not coming back. Take ownership, step out of your comfort zone and take action.",

Don't worry about no stupid things that came through, the day is done. Pack it up, get some rest, you deserve it. But remember this before you actually go to sleep. You're worth it. Everything you've done, everything you're going to do, everyone's really proud of you. I'm proud of you. So just know you did good today, all right? Love.",
